# lifetime

This small page, created with react, should show you how limited your life time is and how much you should use every second.

So many people waste their lives on relatively meaningless things. This little page is to show you how important and irreplaceable your life time is.

Many high-ranking managers have had clocks made that do not show the current time, but their remaining life time based on the average life expectancy of people in the respective country. This way they could make good and effective decisions whether a meeting, an argument or a discussion is worth wasting their precious life time at all.

Such a watch should be owned by every person when they are doing a job they don't want to do, sitting in front of the TV all day, or delaying a reconciliation with a family member after an argument. It should show how precious and irretrievable every second of our life is and if we want something we should not delay it - our life time is limited.

The website should work as follows:

- Enter age, gender and the country you live in.

On the basis of these characteristics (and in the future still some should follow) one can calculate, how long one presumably still possesses valuable life time.
